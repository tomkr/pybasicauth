pybasicauth is a wsgi middleware that ensures people need to be
authenticated to enter a webpage. It does not register who a user is,
it merely closes off a site to the general public. For instance when
setting up a test instance of a Flask app on dotcloud (which is what
it was developed for). Normally you can do some server settings, but
this way you can take your authentication with you when you switch to
a new server.
